The AuthC1 platform uses two types of authentication: application authentication and user authentication.

### Application Authentication

All Authc1 APIs require that you authenticate your application by including a unique `X-Authc1-Id` header in each request.
This header is used to identify your application and ensure that it has the proper permissions to access the requested resources.
You can find your application's `X-Authc1-Id` in the [Authc1 Developer Console](https://developers.authc1.com/applications)

## User Authentication

To authenticate users, AuthC1 uses a token-based authentication system. When a user logs in, they will be given a `id_token` and `access_token`. These tokens must be included in the headers of every API call that requires user authentication.

### Token Expiration

Both the `id_token` and `access_token` have a limited lifespan and will expire after a certain amount of time. When a token expires, the API will return a `401 Unauthorized` error.

### Refreshing Tokens

To avoid having to constantly prompt the user to log in, AuthC1 provides a way for tokens to be refreshed. When a token is close to its expiration date, the application can make a request to the AuthC1 `refresh_token` endpoint to receive a new token.

It is important to note that the `refresh_token` endpoint will only return new tokens if the original `access_token` is still valid. If the `access_token` is expired, the user will need to log in again to receive new tokens.
