## Email and Password Authentication

AuthC1 supports traditional email and password authentication out of the box. Users can register for an account using their email and password, and then use those credentials to log in. Our API also supports password reset and email verification.

## Social Authentication

In addition to email and password, AuthC1 also supports social authentication via providers such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple. This allows users to register and login using their existing social media accounts.

## Phone Number Authentication

AuthC1 also supports phone number authentication, where users can register and login using their phone number and a verification code sent via SMS. This is a convenient and secure option for users who may not have access to email or social media accounts.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

AuthC1 provides support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) which adds an additional layer of security to user accounts. This can include options such as SMS verification, Google Authenticator, and biometric authentication.

## Token-based Authentication

AuthC1 uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for token-based authentication. When a user logs in, they receive an id_token and an access_token. The id_token contains user information and can be used to authenticate the user, while the access_token can be used to make API calls on the user's behalf. Tokens have a configurable expiration time, and can be easily refreshed using the refresh_token.

## Customizable Authentication Workflow

AuthC1 is designed to be flexible and customizable. You can easily customize the authentication workflow to fit your needs. For example, you can add additional fields to the registration form, or add custom logic to handle different types of errors.

## Easy to Integrate

AuthC1 is easy to integrate with existing systems and applications, making it a great choice for developers looking to add robust authentication and authorization capabilities to their projects.

## Scalable and Secure

AuthC1 is built to handle large amounts of users and requests. We use industry standard security practices to ensure that your user's data is safe. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and our API is built to be resistant to common attack methods like brute force and SQL injection.
