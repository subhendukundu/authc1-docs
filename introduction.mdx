Our Authentication API is designed to provide a secure and easy way to authenticate and authorize users for your application. With our API, you can easily implement features such as sign up, login, password reset, email verification, third-party providers such as Google and Facebook and much more.

In this documentation, you will find a comprehensive guide on how to use our API, including examples and best practices. We have also included a customization checklist to help you tailor the API to your specific needs.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Create an Application: Create an application in our system by providing a name. This will give you an application_id and secret which you will use in all API calls.
2. Integrate API: Integrate our API into your application. Use the application_id and secret to authenticate API calls and implement the API endpoints in your application.
3. Customize Settings: Customize settings such as email verification, password policy, and more by updating the settings in your application.
4. Test and Deploy: Test the API integration in your development environment, and then deploy to production.
